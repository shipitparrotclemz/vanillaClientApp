# Creating a Vanilla Server with Java.net

This repository is in a bid to assist a few beloved friends with their homework :)

## Compiling

This is a lean project with one java file, with no dependencies. We are not using Maven as a build tool yet for now.


1. Compiling the file `VanillaServerApp.java`

```
javac src/com/company/VanillaServerApp.java
```

2. Bringing up the server

```
java -cp src com.company.VanillaServerApp
```
